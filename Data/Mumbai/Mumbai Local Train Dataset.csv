Churchgate,CCG,Western,0 KM,0 min,"The Fort area built by the British had three main gates.[1] One of these gates led straight to Saint Thomas Cathedral Church, hence it was named ""Church Gate"". This gate was demolished in 1860. Later the Churchgate railway station was built in 1870 in close proximity to the position of the demolished gate.[2]

Churchgate station is a terminus of Western Railway line of Mumbai suburban railway. It is the southernmost station of the city, though up to the 1931, Colaba was the southernmost station, however the rail line was removed beyond Churchgate, making Churchgate the southernmost station.[3][4]

The Bombay, Baroda and Central India Railway (present Western Railway) was inaugurated in 1855 with the construction of rail line (BG) between Ankleshwar and Uttaran (a distance of 29 miles). In 1859 this line was further extended on the west coast up to Bombay. By 1867, a track along the foreshore, further than Grant Road station was constructed, up to the station named as ""Bombay Backbay"" near Marine Lines. On 12 April 1867, the first suburban train was started with one train each way from Virar to Bombay Back Bay. The stations were then named, ""Viraur, Neela, Bassein, Panje, Borewla, Pahadee, Andaru, Santa Cruz, Bandora, Mahim, Dadur, Grant Road and Bombay Backbay"".
In year 1870, Churchgate was first time mentioned as the station. The line further extended towards Colaba in 1872, and goods shed was built there. In year 1896, a brand new station was established at Colaba to serve as terminus for both passenger and suburban lines. The Government of Bombay issued order to the railway to hand over the section of rail line between Churchgate and Colaba. Therefore, Bombay Central (Mumbai Central), a new station was constructed near Bellasis Bridge, which was opened on 18 December 1930. From the midnight of 31 December, Colaba, ceased to be a terminus.[2]

Presently, this station is home to the Western Railway headquarters. The older Western Railway headquarters is across the road. Today, the station is one of the busiest stations in the city. Trains arrive and depart every minute with clockwork precision. Millions of city dwellers residing in the suburbs alight at this station to get to their offices in the business districts of south Mumbai. The total cost of reconstruction of Churchgate Station was INR 12.8 million approximately, which includes remodelling of the yard, construction of platforms, station premises and offices[5]

The station is the terminus for local trains on Western Railways. The earliest train departs at 4:15 for Virar, and the last train at 1:00 towards Borivali.

Till 2010, the station had platforms which could accommodate 9 and 12 coach trains. But with the introduction of 15-coach trains there was a need to extend the length of the platform. Hence in Dec 2010 work began on extension of the platforms to accommodate the 15-coach trains.[6]

On 28 June 2015 a train derailed after crashing into the end of the platform after not stopping in time. Five people were injured.[7]",4,4,1867

It is also important because of the diamond trading industry located here, mainly in the Panchratna and Prasad chambers building near the railway station.
The word 'Charni' is derived from the Marathi word 'Charne' (to graze), as the area was once used as a grazing ground for cattle and horses.[2] In 1838, the British rulers introduced a 'grazing fee' which several cattle-owners could not afford.[citation needed] Therefore, Sir Jamshedji Jeejeebhoy spent ?20,000 from his own purse for purchasing some grasslands near the seafront at Thakurdwar and saw that the starving cattle grazed without a fee in that area.[citation needed] In time the area became known as ""Charni"" meaning grazing. When a railway station on the BB&CI railway was constructed there it was called Charni Road. The BB&CI line from Back Bay to Virar opened in 1867.[3]

There have also been some controversies during its renovation.[4]

Today Charni road is well known for its old charm Chawls, wholesale markets of diamonds (Opera House), garments, Irani cafés traditional Maharashtrian culture (Girgaon) and also tall skyscrapers. It is not only famous for skyscrapers and chowpatty but also attracts crowds because of the religious places built in it (Mumbadevi temple) and also the famous celebration of Gudipadva and Ganesh Chaturthi festival in Girgaon.

Mumbai Central,MMCT,Western,1 KM,2 min,"Mumbai Central (formerly Bombay Central, station code: MMCT[1]) is a major railway station on the Western line, situated in Mumbai, Maharashtra in an area known by the same name. It serves as a major stop for both Local and Inter-City/Express trains with separate platforms for them. It is also a terminal for several long-distance trains including the Mumbai Rajdhani Express. It is one of the five major Terminal stations in Mumbai while others being Mumbai CST, Mumbai LTT, Mumbai BDTS and Mumbai Dadar. Trains depart from the station connecting various destinations mostly across states in the northern, western and north-western parts of India. The station was renamed from Bombay Central to Mumbai Central in 1997, following the change of Bombay to Mumbai. In 2018, a resolution was passed to change the station code to MMCT,[2] with implementation ongoing.

History
The Bombay Central station was built in response to the government directive to demolish the Churchgate-Colaba rail section owing to land reclamation needs. The BB&CI had to agree to this back in the 1870s, when it had extended the line to Colaba, when the permission to built the terminus was provided on the condition that in the event of any further reclamation schemes, the railway company would shift its railway to any other location between Marine Lines and Colaba.[3] The railway was provided a notice about the directed demolision in 1920. The BB&CI couldn't do this until a new terminus was found. A new station was completed of the name Bombay Central on 18 December 1930, and Colaba Terminus went defunct after the 31st December of the same year.

The Station was designed by the British architect Claude Batley, and constructed by the Shapoorji Pallonji in 1930 in a record time of 21 months. The project was then costed INR 15.6 million.[4] The station opened on 18 December 1930.

When the station opened in 1930, The Times of India suggested that the name Bombay Central was inspired by the Grand Central Terminal in New York City. The paper argued that the station should have been called Kamathipura, after the area it was located in. The paper suggested that the name Kamathipura was probably ruled out, because the area is a red-light district.[5]

The Bombay, Baroda and Central India Railway extended its reach from Baroda to Pathankot via Delhi. The Colaba-Ballard Pier railway station proved insufficient in meeting the demands of a growing population which led the government to make plans for the construction of Bombay Central.

The present suburban route that once ran till Colaba was earlier served by Bellasis Road station. It was renamed Bombay Central (local) after the construction of the long-distance Bombay Central Terminus (BCT) on the eastern side.[6] On 1 Feb 2018, a resolution was passed to change the station code from BCT to MMCT.

Passengers
Prabhadevi railway stations are a set of one of the busiest stations on the Mumbai Suburban Railway network. Over 15.6 million passenger's journey originates from either of these stations, earning ?78 lakh (US$98,000) yearly, due to offices being situated around these railway stations.[2]

History
The railway station on the Prabhadevi side was inaugurated in 1867 which was named Elphinstone Road railway station (with station code EPR) after John, 13th Lord Elphinstone, the Governor of Bombay from 1853 to 1860.

After Independence, there were demands from the local people for the railway station to be renamed to Prabhadevi. This renaming,[3] from the 18th-century Prabhadevi Temple of Hindu goddess Prabhavati Devi located near the station, was first proposed by Shiv Sena leader Diwakar Raote in 1991.[4]

The Maharashtra Legislature passed a resolution to that effect on 16 December 2016,[5] followed by the Maharashtra Government sending a proposal for renaming the station to the Union Home Ministry which was approved on 6 May 2017.[6][7]
After the approval, the name of Elphinstone Road railway station was officially changed to Prabhadevi railway station on 19 July 2018. with its new station code as PBHD with the approval of Indian Railways[8]

Foot-over-bridges
Due to the super-dense crush load on this station, two foot overbridges are constructed between the southern part of the Parel side and the northern part of the Prabhadevi side for easier interchanging between these platforms. Both of them were constructed in 2018.

Before that, there was only one foot overbridge that was narrower in width and older than 50 years, This created problems for commuters during peak hours. Due to this, commuters used to cross the tracks on to the adjoining platform 3 and use the FOB of that platform. This prompted the Railways to put up a fence between the platforms in order to stop commuters from crossing the tracks. This has increased the pressure on the overbridge even more and hence forced the Railways into assigning the Railway Protection Force and Home Guard to help commuters cross the bridge and prevent any stampedes and also help to approach trains.[9]

For that purpose, the first foot overbridge was reconstructed by the joint operation of the Corps of Engineers of the Indian Army and Indian Railways and opened on 27 February 2018, within the time span of 117 days.[10] Whereas the second foot overbridge was newly constructed to reduce the load on the first foot overbridge and make a second interchange on this station, Opened for the public on 18 June 2018.[11]

In 1928, the British Empire connected Andheri station with Trombay by the Great Indian Peninsular Railway under the Bombay Improvement Trust as ""SalsetteTrombay Railway line"" with a view for the opening up of a railway line running West to South-east and linking up Andheri and Kurla station.[5][9] However, in 1934 the line had shut down due to the development of Santacruz Airport.[10]

MetroLocal connection
In February 2014, It was proposed by the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority to integrate the Andheri metro station with the suburban station with the development of the skywalk and the same was proposed for the Ghatkopar metro station.[11]

After the establishment of Mumbai Metro services In June 2014, a skywalk of 12 metres (39 ft) has been developed by the MMRDA for the passengers traveling from local station to the metro station.[12][13] The skywalk has been built opposite to the auto-rickshaw terminal of the station with an expenditure of ?6.04 crore (US$760,000).[14]

Proposed expansion and re-development
The Harbour line of the Andheri station towards Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus and Panvel serves a total number of 55 trains per day, with 46 running to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus and only 9 towards Panvel.[15] The extension between Andheri and Goregaon of the Harbour Line was completed and had started to operate in 2018.[16]

The station was renovated in early 2015 with the establishment of automated escalators and new Automated Ticket Vending Machines (ATVM) for the ease of booking tickets to the daily passengers.[17][18][19] According to the statistics of April 2014 to January 2015, the number of passengers using vending machines was 6,933, whereas in April 2015 to January 2016, it had the higher number of bookings with a total number of 18,316 passengers.[20] Due to the increasing number of passengers travelling on the rooftop of the train coaches, Commissioner of Railway Safety (CRS) electrified the train coaches rooftops containing 25,000 volts.[2][21]

The station has nine platforms, with platform number 1 and 2 serving the Harbour line. Further, the Harbour lines now serves a 12-coach train services.[22] In 2012, it was proposed by the Mumbai Railway Vikas Corporation that the Harbour line trains may get an extension of 12-coaches for the ease of passengers boarding daily from the Western lines.[22] However the MRVC announced that extension of some stations has been completed and the services may start from 2016.[23]

In February 2016, it was reported that the main road of the eastern zone of the station will be re-constructed in according for development of a long delayed elevated auto-rickshaw terminal. The Bombay High Court had ordered to evict the stalls blocking the road. Counsel Anil Sakhare had stated to the court that the stall vendors blocked the construction and infrastructure development and most of the vendors opposed the eviction notice given to them.[24] The work was originally started in 2011 and was to complete in December 2013 but as the corporation was unable to evict the stalls, the work was kept on hold. However, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation had removed the stalls from the road and the construction for the terminal had been started.[25] It has a two-lane terminal measuring the height of 60 metres (200 ft) and a width of 34 metres (112 ft) which connects the Andheri-Kurla road.[26] Under the second phase of MUTP, three escalators and 2 lifts will be installed.[27]

Traffic
Andheri is the busiest station on the Western Railway network. Over 99.6 million passengers' journeys originated at the station during the 201617 fiscal year. During the same period, the station sold ?2.41 crore (US$300,000) worth of tickets (or 9% of all tickets sold on the Western Line) and 890,000 season passes, earning WR a total revenue of ?59.50 crore (US$7.5 million). An average of 66,152 tickets and 2,441 season passes were sold at the station daily, and an average of 256,561 passengers began their journeys at Andheri per day contributing ?1,632,994 (US$20,000) of average daily revenue.[3]
The station consists of a 100 metres (330 ft)-long auto-rickshaw terminal at the eastern zone of Andheri. It has been built between the northern and middle foot-over bridges of the station and its connected to the northern bridge and continues down a road to the MV Road. In addition, the auto-rickshaw services are used for the passengers crossing through the Nityanand Road from the northern bridge to get down the road at the eastern bridge of the station. However, the designed structure was used for commuters serving as the only foot overbridge for the metro station as the terminal was kept unused.[28]

Bus connections
The Oshiwara depot serves as a major hub and transfer point for Andheri bus routes serving the western area. All routes pull into the station's busway off Yari Road bus station, though some can be caught at Goregaon via the station's bus depot entrance as well. The eastern area is connected by buses between Agarkar Chowk Depot and Majas Depot, Ghatkopar Depot, Kurla Depot and Mulund Depot. But due to the increment of the Mumbai Metro service fare rates, the Ghatkopar-Andheri bus services proved to be a beneficial deal for the passengers.[29]",9,9,1928

The station lies on the Western line of the Mumbai Suburban Railway network between Andheri and Ram Mandir railway stations. On March 29, 2018, Harbour line was extended from Mumbai CSMT to Goregaon.[1]

Jogeshwari Station has 6 platforms, where its two platforms of harbour line are constructed towards north of main platforms.",6,7,1867
Ram Mandir,RMAR,Western,2 KM,3 min,"Ram Mandir railway station (station code: RMAR) is a railway station on the Western and Harbour lines of the Mumbai Suburban Railway, serving the Oshiwara locality.[1][2] The station is located in between Jogeshwari railway station and Goregaon railway station and is named after the century-old temple of Lord Ram in its vicinity.[3][4][5] The station was opened to commuters on 22 December 2016.[6]

History
The Ram Mandir Road station, the 37th station on the Western Line, was inaugurated on 22 December 2016, by Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu, after seemingly interminable stages of construction since 2008. Its first train, running from Churchgate to towards Borivli, arrived at 6 pm, while another bound for Churchgate pulled up at 6.10 pm.

The distance between Jogeshwari and Goregaon stations was considered long enough, hence this station was created.

The station has four platforms, two each for Western line slow trains and two for Harbour line section. Harbour line was extended to Goregaon on 29 March 2018.[7]

The station got its name from a 150 year old temple of Lord Ram. The temple is located on sprawling grounds, in Goregaon West, and its weathered dome lends it a pleasant patina of age. A signboard inside the temple informs visitors that it was renovated in 1897, and residents say that a temple existed at the current location prior to that year. The idolsof Lord Ram, Lakshman and Sitainside the sanctum sanctorum of the smaller temple, were transferred to the renovated structure.[citation needed]",4,7,2016
Goregaon,GMN,Western,3 KM,2 min,"Goregaon (Marathi pronunciation: [?o??e?a??], formerly Goregaumn, station code: GMN) is a railway station on the Western line and Harbour line of the Mumbai Suburban Railway network. It serves the suburb of Goregaon. As a general rule, Virar-bound fast trains skip Goregaon, while Borivali-bound fast trains halt here (although there are exceptions) but being in middle between Andheri and Borivali ; it hosts as an important halt for termination and origination of Churchgate and Mumbai CSMT/ Panvel bound services with access to various areas of Dindoshi, Oshiwara, Film City and outlining areas from Malad and Jogeshwari.

What distinguishes Goregaon from Jogeshwari is the four Churchgate-bound fast 'Goregaon Locals' which depart (from platform number 7) at an interval of approximately 30 minutes during the morning rush-hour and Goregaon consists of numerous Churchgate-bound slow ""Goregaon locals"" throughout the day which originate and terminate at Goregaon. Although, Goregaon has not been granted a permanent halt for all fast bound locals as compared to Andheri and Borivali, this station is an important hub for a large number of Western and Harbour line locals which terminate and originate from there.[1] Harbour line which previously ran from Mumbai CSMT till Andheri was extended till Goregaon and services commenced on March 29, 2018. It is supposed to be extended to Borivali in near future.[2]
Station Upgrades
A ?103 crore remodel for Andheri, Jogeshwari, and Goregaon stations was completed in 2014.[3] This remodelling included creation of additional two platforms on the west side of existing platform number 3 (then platform 1) to accommodate Harbour line trains. It also included building an elevated deck above the new platforms with ticketing facilities, and connections to central FOB and skywalk leading to both east and west sides of the station.

Layout
The station currently has five foot-over-bridges (FOBs) and 7 platforms. This station has an additional loop line which serves as Platform 7 as it is useful not only during morning hours for Goregaon-Churchgate bound fast locals during peak hours but also as an extra line during emergency conditions for trains.The outer rail tracks of this station has diversion points for changing of tracks for trains which are the only diversion points present between Andheri railway station and Borivali railway station and extra loop rail tracks for out of service local trains to halt sideways when they are not operational. The upper deck of the station serves as a facility for ticket counters and ATVMs. The southernmost FOB serves passengers exiting the station on the western side and newly constructed eastern side. The middle FOB is connected on the western side to a skywalk that leads to Swami Vivekanand Road. Auto-rickshaw services are available on the main entrances or exits on both the sides of the station.

Platform 1 caters Churchgate bound slow locals (rarely Mumbai CSMT/Panvel locals also available) (trains originate and terminate here)
Platform 2 caters Mumbai CSMT/ Panvel bound slow locals (rarely Churchgate locals also available) (trains originate and terminate here)
Platform 3 caters Virar/Borivali bound slow and semi-fast locals (slow from Andheri)
Platform 4 caters Churchgate bound slow and semi-fast locals (fast from Andheri)
Platform 5 caters Virar/Borivali bound semi-fast locals (slow from Andheri)
Platform 6 caters Churchgate bound semi-fast locals (fast from Andheri)
Platform 7 caters Churchgate bound fast locals originating from Goregaon (in the morning)
Bus Services
On either side of the station BEST has a bus station. The Goregaon depot operates most of the bus routes on the western side of the station (some services are rarely supplied through Oshiwara Depot also) while Dindoshi depot operates most of the eastern side of the station (Bus Route 341 is an exception which is operated by Pratiksha Nagar Depot when it is transported through and from Antop Hill). The Western side of bus services caters bus services from the station to the western areas of Goregaon along with Chincholi area of Malad and farther western areas in Jogeshwari and Andheri.

It serves the Kandivli neighbourhood of Mumbai, India. All slow local trains temporarily halt between Kandivali and Borivali for a few seconds for signaling purposes, which commuters call an imaginary station named Thambevali.[1]

In 2020, during the COVID-19 crisis, Children's Academy along with Project Mumbai undertook a beautification project for Kandivali railway station.[2] Murals of Mandala art were drawn onto the walls of the station. Covid warriors were artistically portrayed on Platform 4.

History
Kandivali was one of the oldest stations in Mumbai, opened back in 1907.[3] It was then known as Khandolee, and is said to have been mainly used to transport the stones and rocks for the Reclamation scheme in Southernmost Bombay. It was made, essentially to service the quarries.[4] The hillock 'Paran' located east of the station, was quarried to provide this material. Subsequently, a railway workshop, and worker quarters were also built.

Platforms
Platform 1 caters mostly to Borivali, Bhayandar, Vasai Road, Nalla Sopara and Virar bound slow trains. Platform 2 caters to Andheri, Bandra, Dadar and Churchgate bound slow and semi fast trains. Platform 3 is very less used and caters to Bhayandar bound slow trains. Platform 4 is also very less used and mostly caters to Churchgate bound semi fast trains and Andheri bound slow trains.

The Borivali Railway Station[2] is a terminus for all slow, semi-fast and fast trains on the Mumbai Suburban Railway system. It also serves as the final city-limit stop for all mail and express trains on Western Railway before leaving Mumbai. As of Oct 2022, the plans to extend the Harbour Line to Borivali, and expansion plans are in full steam, with the survey for land acquisition being completed. [3]

Borivali is used by almost 2.87 lakhs (287,000) passengers every day and is the busiest station on the western suburban line of Mumbai. The number of passengers using Borivali is much higher compared to other stations because many commuters from adjoining stations go there to catch a train as it is impossible to board a local train from stations such as Dahisar, Kandivali or Malad.[citation needed]

History
Borivali is mentioned as one of the stations where the first regular suburban train service of BB&CI halted. Then, it was known as 'Berewla'.[4] This train service was inaugurated between Bombay Backbay station and Viraur on April 12, 1867.[5]

The Station was remodeled in 1913. The remodeling diagrams of the station were published in a BB&CI Magazine dated Dec 1923.

The Magazine (see pg 6, 11)

1913 Remodeling of Borivali

In the Diagrams, the original layout of the station (before 1913 remodeling) shows a two platform station, each platform on the west and east. In the diagram, the one on the west is labelled 'Down Platform' while the east one has an un-understandable label, resembling 'Up or UD'. Between them were the Up and Down main lines. Another separate line was located to the East of the Down Platform. The station appears to have at least one siding, to the North of the Down Platform. The station also had two cabins, named 'Cabin A' and 'Cabin B', located on the east of the main lines.


The original layout of Borivali Station, prior to the 1913 remodeling.
The Revised Layout shows some improvements made; notably, the addition of a new siding line, and the categorization of the Eastern platform as an Island platform. The Siding Line on the west was shifted closer to the down platform, just as the B Cabin was shifted closer to the new Island platform. The number of Track Change points was also increased. (For the diagrams, visit the above Pdf)

Platforms
For the convenience of the passengers Western Railway has decided to change the platform numbers of Borivali station. The platforms have now been numbered from west to east to maintain uniformity. Changes will be effective from 4 June 2017.[6]

As of July 2011, there are 9 platforms at the station and as of 4 June 2017 after renumbering of platform number the trains that these platforms handle are as follows:

1st - Caters to Churchgate bound trains
2nd - Caters to Churchgate bound trains
3rd - Caters to both Churchgate bound and Virar bound Trains
4th - Caters predominantly to Churchgate bound trains
5th - Caters to both Churchgate and Virar bound trains

With the construction of the railway line connecting Dahisar to the city of Mumbai in 1867,[1] came the first lot of migrants, the people from Sindhudurg region of Konkan. These migrants established the first planned residential areas of Dahisar - Maratha Colony in Dahisar East and Mhatre Wadi in the West. The Railway authorities wanted to name the Railhead at Dahisar as Mount Poinsur, but the locals opposed this move and forced the authorities to name it as Dahisar. Currently, it has 4 platforms with 2 for Slow line (Up and Down) and 2 for fast line (Up and Down). All platforms can handle 15-coach Suburban trains.

It is around one and a half hours away by train from Churchgate. Virar is a very crowded area, among other adjacent stations like Vasai Road because it is a major tourist spot. It used to be the only railway station to have services to other stations in Palghar District(in which the city of Virar itself is located), Saphale, Palghar, Dahanu and distant southern cities of Gujarat like Vapi, Surat etc. Since 2013 however, the Western Railway zone Suburban network has been extended up to Dahanu.

History
Virar was the northernmost station on the first regular suburban train service of the erstwhile BB&CI railway (today's Western Railway), that commenced on 12 April 1867 (from Bombay Backbay to Viraur). Then, it was spelt as 'Viraur'. Hence it might be concluded that the station itself was constructed sometime in mid 1860s.

The station was remodeled along with Borivali after or in 1913, similarly to how Borivali was the same year. The old layout of the station was again quite similar to that of Borivali's, having two platforms, Down and Island. The Down platform was located in the West, catering trains toward Saphale, while the Island platform was located in East, catering the up line trains toward Nallasopara, and another branching platform line. The station then had two cabins (A and B) both located South and North of the Down platform respectively.

A BB&CI Magazine from 1923. Visit pg 11 for diagrams of Virar stn. before and after the remodeling- [1]

[2]

After the remodeling, the number and size of the branching lines was increased. The platform line alongside the Island platform was made longer, while another siding was added beside it. The number of track change points was also increased, the 'A cabin' was shifted further southward, along some other changes made to the layout.

After the remodeling, the number and size of several branching lines was increased. One more siding line were added on the east side, while the existing platform line was extended. The number of track change points was increased, while the A cabin was shifted further South, among other changes.

Palghar railway station was supposedly opened in the year 1893, by the erstwhile Bombay, Baroda, and Central India Railway (now, Western Railway). The presence of the station, and due to the plague epidemic of the 1890s, caused the rich from the nearby Mahim-Kelwa village, to settle in the village, aiding in the locality's growth.[6] A Sessional paper of 1901 stated that the double line from Virar to Palghar opened on 1 December 1897, while that from Palghar to Dahanu Rd was opened on 17 January 1898",3,5,1893

History
The railway was extended as a double track from Palghar to Dahanu Road on 17 January 1898 and continued as single track up to Gholvad on 18 October 1900.[1] On 16 April 2013 Western Railway started services for Dahanu Road station i.e. ChurchgateDahanu Local Train (EMU)

In 2002 Western Railway announced that it would extend the EMU service from Virar up to Dahanu Road.[2] On 16 April 2013 Western Railway Started Services For Dahanu Road to Churchgate Using EMU Trains.[3] In January 2012 the Vasai and Virar Municipal Corporation started litigation to force the railway to run direct services from Mumbai Churchgate to Dahanu Road, rather than making passengers change at Virar as at present. The railway replied that they did not have enough trains for through services and the tracks north of Virar were already too busy.[4] In March 2012, Railway Minister Dinesh Trivedi announced additional services on the Virar-Dahanu Road railway.",5,6,1898
CSMT,CSMT/ST,Central 1,0 KM,0 min,"Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (officially Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus since 2017, formerly Victoria Terminus, Bombay station code: CSMT (mainline)[4]/ST (suburban)), is a historic railway terminus and UNESCO World Heritage Site in Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.[5]

The terminus was designed by a British born architectural engineer Frederick William Stevens from an initial design by Axel Haig, in an exuberant Italian Gothic style. Its construction began in 1878, in a location south of the old Bori Bunder railway station,[6] and was completed in 1887, the year marking 50 years of Queen Victoria's rule.

In March 1996 the station name was changed from Victoria Terminus to ""Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus"" (with station code CST) after Shivaji, the 17th-century warrior king and the first Chhatrapati of Maratha Empire who employed guerrilla tactics to contest the Mughal Empire and found a new state in the western Marathi-speaking regions of the Deccan Plateau.[7][8][9]

In 2017, the station was again renamed ""Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus"" (with code CSMT), where the title Maharaj has literal meaning, ""Great king; emperor.""[10] Both former initials ""VT"" and the current, ""CST"", are also commonly used.[11]

The terminus is the headquarters of India's Central Railway. It is one of the busiest railway stations in India,[12] serving as a terminal for both long-distance and suburban trains with a total number of 18 platforms.

History
Victoria Terminus
This famous landmark which has become a symbol of the city, was built as the headquarters of the Great Indian Peninsular Railway.

The railway station was built to replace the Bori Bunder railway station, in the Bori Bunder area of Bombay, a prominent port and warehouse area known for its imports and exports. Since Bombay became a major port city at the time, a bigger station was built to meet its demands, and was named Victoria Terminus, after the then reigning Empress of India, Queen Victoria. The station was designed by Frederick William Stevens, a British born engineer architect, attached to the Bombay office of the Indian colonial Public Works Department. Work began in 1878. He received ?1,614,000 (US$20,000) as the payment for his services.[1] Stevens earned the commission to construct the station after a masterpiece watercolour sketch by draughtsman Axel Haig.[1] The design has been compared to George Gilbert Scott's 1873 St Pancras railway station in London, also in an exuberant Italian Gothic style, but it is far closer to[1][13] Scott's second prize winning entry for Berlin's parliament building, exhibited in London in 1875, which featured numerous towers and turrets, and a large central ribbed dome.[14] The style of the station is also similar to other public buildings of the 1870s in Mumbai, such as the Elphinstone College but especially the buildings of Mumbai University, also designed by G Scott.

The station took ten years to complete,[13] the longest for any building of that era in Mumbai.

Missing statue
During its construction, a marble statue of Queen Victoria was installed in the main façade of the building, in a canopy under the clock. In the 1950s, authorities had begun to remove statues of the British figures from government buildings and public spaces based on a directive from the Government of India.[15] Most of the statues, including that of Queen Victoria, were sent to Victoria Gardens (later renamed Rani Baug) where they were left lying on the grass in the open until at least the 1980s. A Right to Information report was filed, but had no records of the missing statue being exported out of India. Historians now believe that the statue was smuggled out, sold by politicians, or destroyed.[16] The symbol of Progress, another statue, featured on the top of the dome, is often mistaken for that of Queen Victoria.

Renaming
The station has been renamed several times. It was built to replace Bori Bunder, the terminus of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway from 1853 to 1888, and was named Victoria Terminus to commemorate the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria. In 1996, the station was renamed to Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus[17][18] in honour of Emperor Shivaji, founder of the Maratha Empire.

In December 2016, the Fadnavis Ministry passed a resolution to change the name to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus in the Maharashtra Assembly and in May 2017, the home ministry officially sent a letter to the state government denoting the name change, following which the station was yet again renamed as the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus. However, both the former names ""VT"" as well as ""CST"" along with the current name ""CSMT"" are popularly used.[19][20]

2008 Mumbai attacks
Main article: 2008 Mumbai attacks
On 26 November 2008, two Islamic terrorists entered the passenger hall of the CST, opened fire and threw grenades at people. The terrorists were armed with AK-47 rifles. One of the terrorists, Ajmal Kasab, was later caught alive by the police and identified by eyewitnesses. The others did not survive. The attacks began around 21:30 when the two men entered the passenger hall and opened fire,[21][22] The attackers killed 58 people and injured 104 others,[22] their assault ending at about 22:45 after they exited the station via the North FOB towards the west to Cama hospital back entrance. The CCTV evidence was used to identify and indict Kasab.[21] In 2010, Kasab was sentenced to death for his role in the attack, and in 2012 he was hanged.

Structure
The station building is designed in the High Victorian Gothic style of architecture. The building exhibits a fusion of influences from Victorian Italianate Gothic Revival architecture and classical Indian architecture. The skyline, turrets, pointed arches, and eccentric ground plan are close to classical Indian palace architecture. Externally, the wood carving, tiles, ornamental iron and brass railings, grills for the ticket offices, the balustrades for the grand staircases and other ornaments were the work of students at the Sir Jamsetjee Jeejebhoy School of Art. The station stands as an example of 19th-century railway architectural marvels for its advanced structural and technical solutions. The CSMT was constructed using a high level of engineering both in terms of railway and civil engineering. It is one of the first and finest products of the use of industrial technology, merged with the Gothic Revival style in India. The centrally domed office structure has a 330-foot-long platform connected to a 1,200-foot-long train shed, and its outline provides the skeleton plan for the building. CSMT's dome of dovetailed ribs, built without centering, was considered as a novel achievement of the era.

The interior of the building was conceived as a series of large rooms with high ceilings. It is a utilitarian building and has had various changes required by the users, not always sympathetic. It has a C-shaped plan which is symmetrical on an eastwest axis. All the sides of the building are given equal value in the design. It is crowned by a high central dome, which acts as the focal point. The dome is an octagonal ribbed structure with a colossal female figure symbolizing Progress, holding a torch pointing upwards in her right hand and a spoked wheel in her left hand. The side wings enclose the courtyard, which opens on to the street. The wings are anchored by monumental turrets at each of their four corners, which balance and frame the central dome. The façades present the appearance of well-proportioned rows of windows and arches. The ornamentation in the form of statuary, bas-reliefs, and friezes is exuberant yet well controlled. The columns of the entrance gates are crowned by figures of a lion (representing Great Britain) and a tiger (representing India). The main structure is built from a blend of India sandstone and limestone, while high-quality Italian marble was used for the key decorative elements. The main interiors are also decorated: the ground floor of the North Wing, known as the Star Chamber, which is still used as the booking office, is embellished with Italian marble and polished Indian blue stone. The stone arches are covered with carved foliage and grotesques.[25] Internally, the ceiling of the booking hall was originally painted blue, gold and strong red on a ground of rich blue with gold stars. Its walls were lined with glazed tiles made by Maw & Co of Britain.[16] Outside, there are statues representing Commerce, Agriculture, Engineering and Science, with a statue representing Progress on the central dome of the station.[16]

Platforms
CSMT has a total of 18 platformsseven platforms are for suburban EMU trains and eleven platforms (Platform 8 to Platform 18) are for long-distance trains. Rajdhani, Duronto, Garib Rath and Tejas Express leave from Platform No. 18.[26] Air-conditioned dormitories were inaugurated at CST on 16 April 2013. The facility has 58 beds for men and 20 for women.

This Railway station is in Mandvi Section.

According to The Gazetteer of Bombay City and Island (1909),[2] The Masjid station of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, which earns a name from a wealthy mosque in the neighbourhood, is situated about the middle of the section; and close at hand is the Masjid Bandar bridge""[2]

The station has four platforms (two for Harbour Line and two for Main Line). The volume of passengers on this station is very high due to different wholesale markets (i.e., Crawford Market) surrounding the station. These markets, referred to as bazaars, have various wholesale merchants, called stockists.

Stockists from the Iron Market (Lokhand Bazaar), situated on the Eastern side of the railway station and Diamond Traders situated on Western side make trades of millions of Rupees each day in the markets. The southern end towards CSMT leads to Yousuf Mehar Ali Road, Jama Masjid, Kalbadevi, Crawford Market, Mandvi and the surrounding area.

Named after Lord Sandhurst, the Governor of Bombay between 1895 and 1900, the station was built in 1910 using funds from the Bombay City Improvement Trust, which he helped raise. The Sandhurst Road railway station (upper level servicing the Harbour Line) was built in 1921. The supporting pillars of the edifice bear the inscription ""GIPR 1921 Lutha Iron Works, Glasgow"". The fabricated metal was imported from the United Kingdom.[2] It is India's first two-tier station with a 1,728 feet (527 m) long steel viaduct weighing 2,788 tonnes (2,788,000 kg) that carries the Harbour line.[3]

Byculla railway station platform
History
Byculla was one of the original stations when the BombayThane railway was inaugurated in April 1853. It had been built as a wooden structure the year before, but was rebuilt in 1857 as a stone structure. It took on its current form in June 1891.

The first locomotive was brought to Mumbai in 1852 through street of Byculla and around 200 laborers pulled it. This Locomotive, named Lord Falkland (after Bombay's then governor) was stationed on a grove near Byculla bought by the GIPR from a landlord, William Phipps at a cost of ?4000. The engine was used for shunting operations, and had its first run on 18th February, 1852, from Byculla to Parel.[2]


The Old Station

The original Byculla station was located about 500 m south of the current station, beside where the Byculla Mankeshwar is located today. In fact the temple was mentioned by Lady Falkland, (the wife of Bombay's then governor) in her memoir of a rail journey along the line, who stated that the temple ""was on verge of completion, when the line was opened.""[3] The temple, which was located on the east of the former station, is also a prominent element of the station's oldest photos. Also a notable part of the old photos is a bridge on the Parell Rd, on the northern side of the station.


In the above image taken from about 550m North of the old station's site (from current station's FoB), the Mankeshwar Temple can be seen as the yellow temple. The old Station was located just south of the bridge seen in the picture, west(right) of the temple.
A picture of the station from its western platform (reproduced below) was published in the book 'Lokhandi Rastyanchey Sanchipt Varnan', A translation by Krishnashastri Bhatwadekar. The photograph shows the Mankeshwar temple on the right side. The station itself was fenced on either sides. Some buildings can also be seen on the station: one on the western side, and another on the eastern; with the former more elaborately roofed. The bridge can be seen afar, also elaborately designed, with onlookers overlooking the line from above.


The Old Byculla station, 1854 or before.
The published photograph further ascertains the location of the station mentioned above. It matches both the curve of the line at the site today, and the location of the temple at the east. [4]

The station was still a small one. It only had two lines catering it, and didn't have many buildings along with a narrow entrance. Indeed there is an anecdote about Dr. W.C. Eccles, a surgeon of the GIP Railway regarding this element of the station. The incident goes that in 1867, while on an official visit, a shaft of his brougham broke while passing through the then Byculla station's narrow entrance. Determined to get the repairs done, free of the cost, he wrote a letter to the company's agent (General manager) on 6th March 1867, regarding the same. The agent's secretary wrote that this couldn't be sanctioned. This could be a reason, why today's Byculla station has a wide porch.

Nevertheless, the station was fashionable among the upper class British passengers boarded from this station, as it was more elaborate than the terminus, Bori Bunder station.[5]


The Original Workshop

Byculla was also the location, where the first workshops of GIPR were opened in 1854. The workshops were spread over 18 acres of land, with steam sheds, erecting and fitting shops, metal foundries, sawmills, carriage repairing quarters and wagon building sheds, warehouses, timber preservation cabins, offices, and dwelling spaces. The workshops were later shifted to a larger plot at Parel in the 1870s, owing to increased traffic.[6]


Later changes

The station was later Rebuilt in 1857, and then again in 1891. The station was shifted north of its old location, and a larger building was built on the site the present station stands. The new station consisted of the station building, platforms, sheds, footbridges, horse carriage parkings, and staff quarters, all of which were complete by June 1891.

Parel railway station was opened in 1877.[1] Platforms 4 and 5 are reserved for employees of the Parel railway workshop and for some Fast local train stops and platforms 1, 2 and 3 are open to the general public.[2] The station sells around 2.2 million tickets each year.[2]

History
The railway station on the Parel side was opened to the public in 1877 for direct connectivity from Parel to other stations on the Central Railway network.[3] In December 1888, plans for an upgraded station were sent to London, and the plans materialised in early 1890s.[4] Vulcan Foundry Locomotive no.3, one of the first locos sent for GIPR after 1850 was said to be driving a rolling mill in the Parel workshop as late as 1916.[5]

Parel is of historical importance in Railway history, for it was the halting point for the Locomotive Lord Falkland, on its first trip on 18 February 1852 between Byculla and Parel. This was probably because the Governor residence was at Parel back then. Lord Falkland was Bombay's first steam Locomotive, and was later also used for the trial run of the first train that happened on 18 November the same year.(prior to the official journey on 16 April 1853)

The Parel Rail Workshops located south of the station were built between 1877-1879 on 43 acres of land, due to the original Workshops at Byculla being cramped. During the First World War, it was repurposed to make explosive shells, grenades, and armored vehicles.

On 4 March 2019, the terminal platform on the slow line of the Parel side was inaugurated by Piyush Goyal (Minister of Railways) for reducing the higher passenger pressure load at Dadar railway station. Which it was demanded for many years by the people for easier access on the Central side.

Foot over-bridges
Parel railway station has only one foot over-bridge (FOB) on the southern side of the platform. This creates problems for commuters during peak hours. Due to this, commuters used to cross the tracks on to the adjoining platform 3 and use the FOB of that platform. This prompted the Railways to put up a fence between the platforms in order to stop commuters from crossing the tracks. This has increased the pressure on the over-bridge even more and hence forced the Railways into assigning the Railway Protection Force and Home Guard to help commuters cross the bridge and prevent any stampedes. They also protect the commuters from any approaching trains.",3,3,1877

Sion,SIN,Central 1,1 KM,4 min,"Sion is a railway station on the Central line of the Mumbai Suburban Railway network, located in the Mumbai neighborhood of Sion.

Its location near the Mithi River means that the railway between Sion and Kurla, directly to the north,[1] has flooded frequently during the Indian monsoon. However, in 2019, the Central Railway conducted work to raise the trackbed by four to six inches to prevent future flooding. Previously, 30 mm of rain in 24 hours flooded the track, but now there will be no disruption of services with 100 mm of rain per day.[2]

Despite this work, the tracks near this station still experienced waterlogging and flooding during the 2019 floods in Mumbai.[3]

History
Sion can be considered the actual place of inauguration of the GIP Railway, since it was here that the ""first sod for the railway was turned"" by the Chief Secretary of the then Bombay Government, John P. Willoughby. Sion was one of the stations for the First Passenger Train of India (the second stop), that ran on 16th April 1853, where its engines were 'watered' and its wheels greased.[4]

Trains had started halting at Sion since 1853; however, it seems that there was no permanent halting station. In 1872, 107 local inhabitants from Sion and nearby villages sent a petition to the Railway Company (GIPR) to request a station be built. Considering the petitions and the benefits it offered, the GIPR eventually built an official station, the Sion Station.",4,4,1853
Kurla,C/CH,Central 1,1 KM,4 min,"Kurla (formerly Coorla, station code: C) is a railway station on the Central and Harbour lines of the Mumbai Suburban Railway network. It is among the oldest railway stations in India, it being part of the original 21 mile (33.8 km) Great Indian Peninsula Railway (GIPR) section between Bombay (Mumbai) and Tannah (Thane) that opened in 1853.[1]

Local trains terminating at Kurla began operating by 1879, a suburban terminus was built in 1913 and the line was quadrupled in 1915. A single line between Kurla and Chembur that had been laid for garbage clearance in 1906 was opened for suburban traffic in 1924. The service was operated by steam locomotives until the line was electrified in 1950.[2]

The Harbour line was officially opened on 12 December 1910, between Kurla and Reay Road. It was named so because it catered to the eastern neighbourhoods along the city's natural harbour. In 1925, the line was connected to the then Victoria Terminus via an elevated rail corridor between Dockyard Road and Sandhurst Road.[3] The country's first EMU rakes, manufactured by English Electric Company, were introduced between Bombay VT & Kurla on the Harbour line in 1925.[2]

Kurla is having eight operational platforms for the suburban local railway. Platform 1, 1A and 4 serve 'Slow' local trains. Platform 1A formerly served the SalsetteTrombay Railway.[4] Platforms 2 and 3 are dedicated to trains originating and terminating at Kurla.

It is the origin and destination station of all the trans-harbour suburban trains. Thane is India's first passenger railway Station along with Bori Bunder Railway Station.

History
Thane railway station was the terminus for the first ever passenger train in India. On 16 April 1853, the first passenger train service was inaugurated from Bori Bunder (now renamed Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus), Mumbai to Thane.[2] Covering a distance of 34 kilometres (21 mi), it was hauled by three locomotives: Sahib, Sindh, and Sultan, and carried around 400 passengers.

The First Trial Train Journey
About five months before this inaugural journey, a trial run was conducted from near Bori Bunder to the Parsick (Parsik) Point in Tannah (now Thane). This journey started on the noon of 18th November 1852, soon after 12 p.m, with the Directors, Engineers of the GIP Railway (the company that built the line), along with their friends.The train was pulled by Bombay's first steam locomotive, Lord Falkland, with temporarily arranged 'trucks' as rail carriages, since the three Locomotives and the coaches for the company had not yet been made ready (since they arrived just 2 months ago in September 1852). The party was planned to reach their destination at Parsik Point at about 1 p.m., have their tiffin inside the 100 yard tunnel there, and return back to Bombay by sunset, reports the Allen's Indian Mail, 1852.[3]

The Official Journey
The scene during the official journey in April 1853 was even extravagant. The 14 coach train, carrying in all 400 passengers, started its journey at the Bori Bunder Station, where there grand celebrations, with a decorated platform, arriving invitees, playing band, among other others. At Thane, the case was no different. When the train finally approached Thana, people crowded thickly on the sides for more than a mile, and had to be kept in control by the Ghat police, On the arrival, the passengers were welcomed by large erected tents, under which they would have their food, and no demands overlooked. There were also speeches, delivered by the present gentlemen. Among the speakers, was the Chief Engineer of the GIP Railway, James.J.Berkeley.

The terminus was designed by a British born architectural engineer Frederick William Stevens from an initial design by Axel Haig, in an exuberant Italian Gothic style. Its construction began in 1878, in a location south of the old Bori Bunder railway station,[6] and was completed in 1887, the year marking 50 years of Queen Victoria's rule.

In March 1996 the station name was changed from Victoria Terminus to ""Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus"" (with station code CST) after Shivaji, the 17th-century warrior king and the first Chhatrapati of Maratha Empire who employed guerrilla tactics to contest the Mughal Empire and found a new state in the western Marathi-speaking regions of the Deccan Plateau.[7][8][9]

In 2017, the station was again renamed ""Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus"" (with code CSMT), where the title Maharaj has literal meaning, ""Great king; emperor.""[10] Both former initials ""VT"" and the current, ""CST"", are also commonly used.[11]

The terminus is the headquarters of India's Central Railway. It is one of the busiest railway stations in India,[12] serving as a terminal for both long-distance and suburban trains with a total number of 18 platforms.

History
Victoria Terminus
This famous landmark which has become a symbol of the city, was built as the headquarters of the Great Indian Peninsular Railway.

The railway station was built to replace the Bori Bunder railway station, in the Bori Bunder area of Bombay, a prominent port and warehouse area known for its imports and exports. Since Bombay became a major port city at the time, a bigger station was built to meet its demands, and was named Victoria Terminus, after the then reigning Empress of India, Queen Victoria. The station was designed by Frederick William Stevens, a British born engineer architect, attached to the Bombay office of the Indian colonial Public Works Department. Work began in 1878. He received ?1,614,000 (US$20,000) as the payment for his services.[1] Stevens earned the commission to construct the station after a masterpiece watercolour sketch by draughtsman Axel Haig.[1] The design has been compared to George Gilbert Scott's 1873 St Pancras railway station in London, also in an exuberant Italian Gothic style, but it is far closer to[1][13] Scott's second prize winning entry for Berlin's parliament building, exhibited in London in 1875, which featured numerous towers and turrets, and a large central ribbed dome.[14] The style of the station is also similar to other public buildings of the 1870s in Mumbai, such as the Elphinstone College but especially the buildings of Mumbai University, also designed by G Scott.

The station took ten years to complete,[13] the longest for any building of that era in Mumbai.

Missing statue
During its construction, a marble statue of Queen Victoria was installed in the main façade of the building, in a canopy under the clock. In the 1950s, authorities had begun to remove statues of the British figures from government buildings and public spaces based on a directive from the Government of India.[15] Most of the statues, including that of Queen Victoria, were sent to Victoria Gardens (later renamed Rani Baug) where they were left lying on the grass in the open until at least the 1980s. A Right to Information report was filed, but had no records of the missing statue being exported out of India. Historians now believe that the statue was smuggled out, sold by politicians, or destroyed.[16] The symbol of Progress, another statue, featured on the top of the dome, is often mistaken for that of Queen Victoria.

Renaming
The station has been renamed several times. It was built to replace Bori Bunder, the terminus of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway from 1853 to 1888, and was named Victoria Terminus to commemorate the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria. In 1996, the station was renamed to Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus[17][18] in honour of Emperor Shivaji, founder of the Maratha Empire.

In December 2016, the Fadnavis Ministry passed a resolution to change the name to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus in the Maharashtra Assembly and in May 2017, the home ministry officially sent a letter to the state government denoting the name change, following which the station was yet again renamed as the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus. However, both the former names ""VT"" as well as ""CST"" along with the current name ""CSMT"" are popularly used.[19][20]

2008 Mumbai attacks
Main article: 2008 Mumbai attacks
On 26 November 2008, two Islamic terrorists entered the passenger hall of the CST, opened fire and threw grenades at people. The terrorists were armed with AK-47 rifles. One of the terrorists, Ajmal Kasab, was later caught alive by the police and identified by eyewitnesses. The others did not survive. The attacks began around 21:30 when the two men entered the passenger hall and opened fire,[21][22] The attackers killed 58 people and injured 104 others,[22] their assault ending at about 22:45 after they exited the station via the North FOB towards the west to Cama hospital back entrance. The CCTV evidence was used to identify and indict Kasab.[21] In 2010, Kasab was sentenced to death for his role in the attack, and in 2012 he was hanged.

Structure
The station building is designed in the High Victorian Gothic style of architecture. The building exhibits a fusion of influences from Victorian Italianate Gothic Revival architecture and classical Indian architecture. The skyline, turrets, pointed arches, and eccentric ground plan are close to classical Indian palace architecture. Externally, the wood carving, tiles, ornamental iron and brass railings, grills for the ticket offices, the balustrades for the grand staircases and other ornaments were the work of students at the Sir Jamsetjee Jeejebhoy School of Art. The station stands as an example of 19th-century railway architectural marvels for its advanced structural and technical solutions. The CSMT was constructed using a high level of engineering both in terms of railway and civil engineering. It is one of the first and finest products of the use of industrial technology, merged with the Gothic Revival style in India. The centrally domed office structure has a 330-foot-long platform connected to a 1,200-foot-long train shed, and its outline provides the skeleton plan for the building. CSMT's dome of dovetailed ribs, built without centering, was considered as a novel achievement of the era.

The interior of the building was conceived as a series of large rooms with high ceilings. It is a utilitarian building and has had various changes required by the users, not always sympathetic. It has a C-shaped plan which is symmetrical on an eastwest axis. All the sides of the building are given equal value in the design. It is crowned by a high central dome, which acts as the focal point. The dome is an octagonal ribbed structure with a colossal female figure symbolizing Progress, holding a torch pointing upwards in her right hand and a spoked wheel in her left hand. The side wings enclose the courtyard, which opens on to the street. The wings are anchored by monumental turrets at each of their four corners, which balance and frame the central dome. The façades present the appearance of well-proportioned rows of windows and arches. The ornamentation in the form of statuary, bas-reliefs, and friezes is exuberant yet well controlled. The columns of the entrance gates are crowned by figures of a lion (representing Great Britain) and a tiger (representing India). The main structure is built from a blend of India sandstone and limestone, while high-quality Italian marble was used for the key decorative elements. The main interiors are also decorated: the ground floor of the North Wing, known as the Star Chamber, which is still used as the booking office, is embellished with Italian marble and polished Indian blue stone. The stone arches are covered with carved foliage and grotesques.[25] Internally, the ceiling of the booking hall was originally painted blue, gold and strong red on a ground of rich blue with gold stars. Its walls were lined with glazed tiles made by Maw & Co of Britain.[16] Outside, there are statues representing Commerce, Agriculture, Engineering and Science, with a statue representing Progress on the central dome of the station.[16]

Platforms
CSMT has a total of 18 platformsseven platforms are for suburban EMU trains and eleven platforms (Platform 8 to Platform 18) are for long-distance trains. Rajdhani, Duronto, Garib Rath and Tejas Express leave from Platform No. 18.[26] Air-conditioned dormitories were inaugurated at CST on 16 April 2013. The facility has 58 beds for men and 20 for women.

In popular culture
The station has been the location of filming the ""Jai Ho"" song in Slumdog Millionaire;[28] and the 2011 Indian film Ra.One.",7,7,1878

It is the penultimate stop for all trains on those lines in the ""up"" direction. It was opened in 1877.[1] The station is named after a masjid (mosque) annexed to this Suburban Railway Station.[2] Contrary to popular belief a synagogue, is never called a masjid. This Railway station is in Mandvi Section.

According to The Gazetteer of Bombay City and Island (1909),[2] The Masjid station of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, which earns a name from a wealthy mosque in the neighbourhood, is situated about the middle of the section; and close at hand is the Masjid Bandar bridge""[2]

The station has four platforms (two for Harbour Line and two for Main Line). The volume of passengers on this station is very high due to different wholesale markets (i.e., Crawford Market) surrounding the station. These markets, referred to as bazaars, have various wholesale merchants, called stockists.

Byculla railway station platform
History
Byculla was one of the original stations when the BombayThane railway was inaugurated in April 1853. It had been built as a wooden structure the year before, but was rebuilt in 1857 as a stone structure. It took on its current form in June 1891.

The first locomotive was brought to Mumbai in 1852 through street of Byculla and around 200 laborers pulled it. This Locomotive, named Lord Falkland (after Bombay's then governor) was stationed on a grove near Byculla bought by the GIPR from a landlord, William Phipps at a cost of ?4000. The engine was used for shunting operations, and had its first run on 18th February, 1852, from Byculla to Parel.[2]


The Old Station

The original Byculla station was located about 500 m south of the current station, beside where the Byculla Mankeshwar is located today. In fact the temple was mentioned by Lady Falkland, (the wife of Bombay's then governor) in her memoir of a rail journey along the line, who stated that the temple ""was on verge of completion, when the line was opened.""[3] The temple, which was located on the east of the former station, is also a prominent element of the station's oldest photos. Also a notable part of the old photos is a bridge on the Parell Rd, on the northern side of the station.


In the above image taken from about 550m North of the old station's site (from current station's FoB), the Mankeshwar Temple can be seen as the yellow temple. The old Station was located just south of the bridge seen in the picture, west(right) of the temple.
A picture of the station from its western platform (reproduced below) was published in the book 'Lokhandi Rastyanchey Sanchipt Varnan', A translation by Krishnashastri Bhatwadekar. The photograph shows the Mankeshwar temple on the right side. The station itself was fenced on either sides. Some buildings can also be seen on the station: one on the western side, and another on the eastern; with the former more elaborately roofed. The bridge can be seen afar, also elaborately designed, with onlookers overlooking the line from above.


The Old Byculla station, 1854 or before.
The published photograph further ascertains the location of the station mentioned above. It matches both the curve of the line at the site today, and the location of the temple at the east. [4]

The station was still a small one. It only had two lines catering it, and didn't have many buildings along with a narrow entrance. Indeed there is an anecdote about Dr. W.C. Eccles, a surgeon of the GIP Railway regarding this element of the station. The incident goes that in 1867, while on an official visit, a shaft of his brougham broke while passing through the then Byculla station's narrow entrance. Determined to get the repairs done, free of the cost, he wrote a letter to the company's agent (General manager) on 6th March 1867, regarding the same. The agent's secretary wrote that this couldn't be sanctioned. This could be a reason, why today's Byculla station has a wide porch.

Nevertheless, the station was fashionable among the upper class British passengers boarded from this station, as it was more elaborate than the terminus, Bori Bunder station.[5]


The Original Workshop

Byculla was also the location, where the first workshops of GIPR were opened in 1854. The workshops were spread over 18 acres of land, with steam sheds, erecting and fitting shops, metal foundries, sawmills, carriage repairing quarters and wagon building sheds, warehouses, timber preservation cabins, offices, and dwelling spaces. The workshops were later shifted to a larger plot at Parel in the 1870s, owing to increased traffic.[6]


Later changes

The station was later Rebuilt in 1857, and then again in 1891. The station was shifted north of its old location, and a larger building was built on the site the present station stands. The new station consisted of the station building, platforms, sheds, footbridges, horse carriage parkings, and staff quarters, all of which were complete by June 1891.

Parel railway station was opened in 1877.[1] Platforms 4 and 5 are reserved for employees of the Parel railway workshop and for some Fast local train stops and platforms 1, 2 and 3 are open to the general public.[2] The station sells around 2.2 million tickets each year.[2]

History
The railway station on the Parel side was opened to the public in 1877 for direct connectivity from Parel to other stations on the Central Railway network.[3] In December 1888, plans for an upgraded station were sent to London, and the plans materialised in early 1890s.[4] Vulcan Foundry Locomotive no.3, one of the first locos sent for GIPR after 1850 was said to be driving a rolling mill in the Parel workshop as late as 1916.[5]

Parel is of historical importance in Railway history, for it was the halting point for the Locomotive Lord Falkland, on its first trip on 18 February 1852 between Byculla and Parel. This was probably because the Governor residence was at Parel back then. Lord Falkland was Bombay's first steam Locomotive, and was later also used for the trial run of the first train that happened on 18 November the same year.(prior to the official journey on 16 April 1853)

The Parel Rail Workshops located south of the station were built between 1877-1879 on 43 acres of land, due to the original Workshops at Byculla being cramped. During the First World War, it was repurposed to make explosive shells, grenades, and armored vehicles.

On 4 March 2019, the terminal platform on the slow line of the Parel side was inaugurated by Piyush Goyal (Minister of Railways) for reducing the higher passenger pressure load at Dadar railway station. Which it was demanded for many years by the people for easier access on the Central side.

Foot over-bridges
Parel railway station has only one foot over-bridge (FOB) on the southern side of the platform. This creates problems for commuters during peak hours. Due to this, commuters used to cross the tracks on to the adjoining platform 3 and use the FOB of that platform. This prompted the Railways to put up a fence between the platforms in order to stop commuters from crossing the tracks. This has increased the pressure on the over-bridge even more and hence forced the Railways into assigning the Railway Protection Force and Home Guard to help commuters cross the bridge and prevent any stampedes. They also protect the commuters from any approaching trains.",3,3,1877

Sion,SIN,Central 2,1 KM,4 min,"Sion is a railway station on the Central line of the Mumbai Suburban Railway network, located in the Mumbai neighborhood of Sion.

Its location near the Mithi River means that the railway between Sion and Kurla, directly to the north,[1] has flooded frequently during the Indian monsoon. However, in 2019, the Central Railway conducted work to raise the trackbed by four to six inches to prevent future flooding. Previously, 30 mm of rain in 24 hours flooded the track, but now there will be no disruption of services with 100 mm of rain per day.[2]

Despite this work, the tracks near this station still experienced waterlogging and flooding during the 2019 floods in Mumbai.[3]

History
Sion can be considered the actual place of inauguration of the GIP Railway, since it was here that the ""first sod for the railway was turned"" by the Chief Secretary of the then Bombay Government, John P. Willoughby. Sion was one of the stations for the First Passenger Train of India (the second stop), that ran on 16th April 1853, where its engines were 'watered' and its wheels greased.[4]

Trains had started halting at Sion since 1853; however, it seems that there was no permanent halting station. In 1872, 107 local inhabitants from Sion and nearby villages sent a petition to the Railway Company (GIPR) to request a station be built. Considering the petitions and the benefits it offered, the GIPR eventually built an official station, the Sion Station.",4,4,1853

Local trains terminating at Kurla began operating by 1879, a suburban terminus was built in 1913 and the line was quadrupled in 1915. A single line between Kurla and Chembur that had been laid for garbage clearance in 1906 was opened for suburban traffic in 1924. The service was operated by steam locomotives until the line was electrified in 1950.[2]

The Harbour line was officially opened on 12 December 1910, between Kurla and Reay Road. It was named so because it catered to the eastern neighbourhoods along the city's natural harbour. In 1925, the line was connected to the then Victoria Terminus via an elevated rail corridor between Dockyard Road and Sandhurst Road.[3] The country's first EMU rakes, manufactured by English Electric Company, were introduced between Bombay VT & Kurla on the Harbour line in 1925.[2]

Kurla is having eight operational platforms for the suburban local railway. Platform 1, 1A and 4 serve 'Slow' local trains.

The First Trial Train Journey
About five months before this inaugural journey, a trial run was conducted from near Bori Bunder to the Parsick (Parsik) Point in Tannah (now Thane). This journey started on the noon of 18th November 1852, soon after 12 p.m, with the Directors, Engineers of the GIP Railway (the company that built the line), along with their friends.The train was pulled by Bombay's first steam locomotive, Lord Falkland, with temporarily arranged 'trucks' as rail carriages, since the three Locomotives and the coaches for the company had not yet been made ready (since they arrived just 2 months ago in September 1852).

CSMT,CSMT/ST,Harbour,0 KM,0 min,"Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (officially Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus since 2017, formerly Victoria Terminus, Bombay station code: CSMT (mainline)[4]/ST (suburban)), is a historic railway terminus and UNESCO World Heritage Site in Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.[5]

The terminus was designed by a British born architectural engineer Frederick William Stevens from an initial design by Axel Haig, in an exuberant Italian Gothic style. Its construction began in 1878, in a location south of the old Bori Bunder railway station,[6] and was completed in 1887, the year marking 50 years of Queen Victoria's rule.

In March 1996 the station name was changed from Victoria Terminus to ""Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus"" (with station code CST) after Shivaji, the 17th-century warrior king and the first Chhatrapati of Maratha Empire who employed guerrilla tactics to contest the Mughal Empire and found a new state in the western Marathi-speaking regions of the Deccan Plateau.[7][8][9]

In 2017, the station was again renamed ""Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus"" (with code CSMT), where the title Maharaj has literal meaning, ""Great king; emperor.""[10] Both former initials ""VT"" and the current, ""CST"", are also commonly used.[11]

The terminus is the headquarters of India's Central Railway. It is one of the busiest railway stations in India,[12] serving as a terminal for both long-distance and suburban trains with a total number of 18 platforms.

History
Victoria Terminus
This famous landmark which has become a symbol of the city, was built as the headquarters of the Great Indian Peninsular Railway.

The railway station was built to replace the Bori Bunder railway station, in the Bori Bunder area of Bombay, a prominent port and warehouse area known for its imports and exports. Since Bombay became a major port city at the time, a bigger station was built to meet its demands, and was named Victoria Terminus, after the then reigning Empress of India, Queen Victoria. The station was designed by Frederick William Stevens, a British born engineer architect, attached to the Bombay office of the Indian colonial Public Works Department. Work began in 1878. He received ?1,614,000 (US$20,000) as the payment for his services.[1] Stevens earned the commission to construct the station after a masterpiece watercolour sketch by draughtsman Axel Haig.[1] The design has been compared to George Gilbert Scott's 1873 St Pancras railway station in London, also in an exuberant Italian Gothic style, but it is far closer to[1][13] Scott's second prize winning entry for Berlin's parliament building, exhibited in London in 1875, which featured numerous towers and turrets, and a large central ribbed dome.[14] The style of the station is also similar to other public buildings of the 1870s in Mumbai, such as the Elphinstone College but especially the buildings of Mumbai University, also designed by G Scott.

The station took ten years to complete,[13] the longest for any building of that era in Mumbai.

Missing statue
During its construction, a marble statue of Queen Victoria was installed in the main façade of the building, in a canopy under the clock. In the 1950s, authorities had begun to remove statues of the British figures from government buildings and public spaces based on a directive from the Government of India.[15] Most of the statues, including that of Queen Victoria, were sent to Victoria Gardens (later renamed Rani Baug) where they were left lying on the grass in the open until at least the 1980s. A Right to Information report was filed, but had no records of the missing statue being exported out of India. Historians now believe that the statue was smuggled out, sold by politicians, or destroyed.[16] The symbol of Progress, another statue, featured on the top of the dome, is often mistaken for that of Queen Victoria.

Renaming
The station has been renamed several times. It was built to replace Bori Bunder, the terminus of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway from 1853 to 1888, and was named Victoria Terminus to commemorate the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria. In 1996, the station was renamed to Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus[17][18] in honour of Emperor Shivaji, founder of the Maratha Empire.

In December 2016, the Fadnavis Ministry passed a resolution to change the name to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus in the Maharashtra Assembly and in May 2017, the home ministry officially sent a letter to the state government denoting the name change, following which the station was yet again renamed as the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus. However, both the former names ""VT"" as well as ""CST"" along with the current name ""CSMT"" are popularly used.[19][20]

2008 Mumbai attacks
Main article: 2008 Mumbai attacks
On 26 November 2008, two Islamic terrorists entered the passenger hall of the CST, opened fire and threw grenades at people. The terrorists were armed with AK-47 rifles. One of the terrorists, Ajmal Kasab, was later caught alive by the police and identified by eyewitnesses. The others did not survive. The attacks began around 21:30 when the two men entered the passenger hall and opened fire,[21][22] The attackers killed 58 people and injured 104 others,[22] their assault ending at about 22:45 after they exited the station via the North FOB towards the west to Cama hospital back entrance. The CCTV evidence was used to identify and indict Kasab.[21] In 2010, Kasab was sentenced to death for his role in the attack, and in 2012 he was hanged.

Structure
The station building is designed in the High Victorian Gothic style of architecture. The building exhibits a fusion of influences from Victorian Italianate Gothic Revival architecture and classical Indian architecture. The skyline, turrets, pointed arches, and eccentric ground plan are close to classical Indian palace architecture. Externally, the wood carving, tiles, ornamental iron and brass railings, grills for the ticket offices, the balustrades for the grand staircases and other ornaments were the work of students at the Sir Jamsetjee Jeejebhoy School of Art. The station stands as an example of 19th-century railway architectural marvels for its advanced structural and technical solutions. The CSMT was constructed using a high level of engineering both in terms of railway and civil engineering. It is one of the first and finest products of the use of industrial technology, merged with the Gothic Revival style in India. The centrally domed office structure has a 330-foot-long platform connected to a 1,200-foot-long train shed, and its outline provides the skeleton plan for the building. CSMT's dome of dovetailed ribs, built without centering, was considered as a novel achievement of the era.

The interior of the building was conceived as a series of large rooms with high ceilings. It is a utilitarian building and has had various changes required by the users, not always sympathetic. It has a C-shaped plan which is symmetrical on an eastwest axis. All the sides of the building are given equal value in the design. It is crowned by a high central dome, which acts as the focal point. The dome is an octagonal ribbed structure with a colossal female figure symbolizing Progress, holding a torch pointing upwards in her right hand and a spoked wheel in her left hand. The side wings enclose the courtyard, which opens on to the street. The wings are anchored by monumental turrets at each of their four corners, which balance and frame the central dome. The façades present the appearance of well-proportioned rows of windows and arches. The ornamentation in the form of statuary, bas-reliefs, and friezes is exuberant yet well controlled. The columns of the entrance gates are crowned by figures of a lion (representing Great Britain) and a tiger (representing India). The main structure is built from a blend of India sandstone and limestone, while high-quality Italian marble was used for the key decorative elements. The main interiors are also decorated: the ground floor of the North Wing, known as the Star Chamber, which is still used as the booking office, is embellished with Italian marble and polished Indian blue stone. The stone arches are covered with carved foliage and grotesques.[25] Internally, the ceiling of the booking hall was originally painted blue, gold and strong red on a ground of rich blue with gold stars. Its walls were lined with glazed tiles made by Maw & Co of Britain.[16] Outside, there are statues representing Commerce, Agriculture, Engineering and Science, with a statue representing Progress on the central dome of the station.[16]

Platforms
CSMT has a total of 18 platformsseven platforms are for suburban EMU trains and eleven platforms (Platform 8 to Platform 18) are for long-distance trains. Rajdhani, Duronto, Garib Rath and Tejas Express leave from Platform No. 18.[26] Air-conditioned dormitories were inaugurated at CST on 16 April 2013. The facility has 58 beds for men and 20 for women.

Local trains terminating at Kurla began operating by 1879, a suburban terminus was built in 1913 and the line was quadrupled in 1915. A single line between Kurla and Chembur that had been laid for garbage clearance in 1906 was opened for suburban traffic in 1924. The service was operated by steam locomotives until the line was electrified in 1950.[2]

The Harbour line was officially opened on 12 December 1910, between Kurla and Reay Road. It was named so because it catered to the eastern neighbourhoods along the city's natural harbour. In 1925, the line was connected to the then Victoria Terminus via an elevated rail corridor between Dockyard Road and Sandhurst Road.[3] The country's first EMU rakes, manufactured by English Electric Company, were introduced between Bombay VT & Kurla on the Harbour line in 1925.[2]

The Indian Railways ministry had commissioned the independent commuter railway services in 1964.[4] In addition, a number of development activities have been conducted, including track expansions, electrification of the coaches and addition of long-route express trains.

Proposed terminus development
In 2007, the Central Railways ministries had proposed to develop a terminus, serving the inbound and outbound long distance express trains.[9] According to the general manager, V. K. Kaul, it was announced that the project will be developed with an expenditure of ?22 crore (US$2.8 million).[6] City and Industrial Development Corporation (CIDCO) stated that the corporation also has a two-thirds of expenditure on the project and the CR has the major expenditure plan. However, in 2015 the project was re-announced with a total expenditure of ?126 crore (US$16 million) from the CR ministries.[10] The CR ministries also stated that the development of the terminus will be completed in 2018.[10] The terminus also consists two separate platforms for the express trains.[11]

Implementation of shuttle train services
In 2006, the Central Railways ministries had proposed the shuttle train services between Karjat station and Panvel. The plan was implemented as the cargo service trains uses the single track of the PanvelKarjat route.[5] In October 2015, the shuttle train services were started between Diva station and Panvel on the trial basis. Due to the establishment of shuttle train services, the commuters from the New Panvel can travel directly to Diva.[17][18] A new shuttle train service is going to be commissioned between Panvel and Bhiwandi / Vasai / Virar stations which is a 70 km project. Currently,[when?] there are 13 stations on this route. 11 more stations are to be built after the project commences.

History
Inauguration
The station was introduced as the PanvelDiva railway line, serving as rail freight transport in 1962 and was used for cargo services. The Indian Railways ministry had commissioned the independent commuter railway services in 1964.[4] In addition, a number of development activities have been conducted, including track expansions, electrification of the coaches and addition of long-route express trains.

Proposed terminus development
In 2007, the Central Railways ministries had proposed to develop a terminus, serving the inbound and outbound long distance express trains.[9] According to the general manager, V. K. Kaul, it was announced that the project will be developed with an expenditure of ?22 crore (US$2.8 million).[6] City and Industrial Development Corporation (CIDCO) stated that the corporation also has a two-thirds of expenditure on the project and the CR has the major expenditure plan. However, in 2015 the project was re-announced with a total expenditure of ?126 crore (US$16 million) from the CR ministries.[10] The CR ministries also stated that the development of the terminus will be completed in 2018.[10] The terminus also consists two separate platforms for the express trains.[11]

Services and further development
CIDCO corridor project
CIDCO has implemented a six-corridor railway project including the MankhurdBelapurPanvel Railway Line and Panvel/BelapurUran Railway Line. The project will be developed with an expenditure on a ratio of 67:33; ?466 crore (US$58 million) from Indian Railways and ?946 crore (US$120 million) from CIDCO,[12] covering a length of 200 kilometres (120 mi) and occupying 900 hectares of land.[1]

The MankhurdBelapurPanvel Railway Corridor Line was first commissioned on 25 January 1995 as a single line connecting to Khandeshwar station from Belapur station. The line was subsequently expanded to Panvel on 29 June 1998. On 14 April 2000, the line got subsequently expanded as double line services from Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus to Panvel.[13]

The Panvel/BelapurUran Corridor Line was originally planned in 1996, but later it was halted due to unknown reasons in 2008.[12] According to the 2009 reports, the expenses of the project was around ?1,412.17 crore (US$180 million), including the expenses of constructing foot-over bridges and installation of railway network for Belapur station from the proposed station Sagarganga (Kille).[14] The planned stations between the route including Seawoods, Sagar Sangam, Targhar, Bamandongari, Kharkopar, Gavhan, Ranjanpada, Nava-Sheva, Dronagiri and Uran with a length of 27 kilometres (17 mi), will be developed in the first phase of the project in 2017.[15] Due to the scarcity of the land required for the tracks development, a 4 kilometres (2.5 mi) of forest land between Gavhan and Ranjanpada stations will be acquired by the corporation for phase 2 of the development.[16]

Implementation of shuttle train services
In 2006, the Central Railways ministries had proposed the shuttle train services between Karjat station and Panvel. The plan was implemented as the cargo service trains uses the single track of the PanvelKarjat route.[5] In October 2015, the shuttle train services were started between Diva station and Panvel on the trial basis. Due to the establishment of shuttle train services, the commuters from the New Panvel can travel directly to Diva.[17][18] A new shuttle train service is going to be commissioned between Panvel and Bhiwandi / Vasai / Virar stations which is a 70 km project. Currently,[when?] there are 13 stations on this route. 11 more stations are to be built after the project commences.

Track elevation
In 2012, CIDCO had proposed a 25 kilometres (16 mi) metro corridor of Navi Mumbai Metro, linking from Belapur to the proposed Navi Mumbai International Airport.[19]

However, in January 2016, the CST-Panvel elevated corridor project was proposed by Mumbai Railway Vikas Corporation (MVRC) to connect the route along Palm Beach Marg to the proposed international airport. The corridor, although was originally proposed to link the parallel route between Reay Road and Panvel.[3] The report was revised in February 2016 of the project and was stated that the corridor will be integrated with the Navi Mumbai Metro, connecting the Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport to the proposed airport.[20][21]

In June 2014, it was announced that the PanvelKarjat route will get track extension under the phase 3 of the Mumbai Urban Transport Project scheme with an expenditure of ?1,809 crore (US$230 million).[22] In February 2015, MVRC approved the extension of tracks with an expenditure of ?2,024 crore (US$250 million); reducing the distance of the route to 78 kilometres (48 mi).[23]

Virar is a terminus station. It is around one and a half hours away by train from Churchgate. Virar is a very crowded area, among other adjacent stations like Vasai Road because it is a major tourist spot. It used to be the only railway station to have services to other stations in Palghar District(in which the city of Virar itself is located), Saphale, Palghar, Dahanu and distant southern cities of Gujarat like Vapi, Surat etc. Since 2013 however, the Western Railway zone Suburban network has been extended up to Dahanu.

History
Virar was the northernmost station on the first regular suburban train service of the erstwhile BB&CI railway (today's Western Railway), that commenced on 12 April 1867 (from Bombay Backbay to Viraur). Then, it was spelt as 'Viraur'. Hence it might be concluded that the station itself was constructed sometime in mid 1860s.

The station was remodeled along with Borivali after or in 1913, similarly to how Borivali was the same year. The old layout of the station was again quite similar to that of Borivali's, having two platforms, Down and Island. The Down platform was located in the West, catering trains toward Saphale, while the Island platform was located in East, catering the up line trains toward Nallasopara, and another branching platform line. The station then had two cabins (A and B) both located South and North of the Down platform respectively.

A BB&CI Magazine from 1923. Visit pg 11 for diagrams of Virar stn. before and after the remodeling- [1]

[2]

After the remodeling, the number and size of the branching lines was increased. The platform line alongside the Island platform was made longer, while another siding was added beside it. The number of track change points was also increased, the 'A cabin' was shifted further southward, along some other changes made to the layout.

After the remodeling, the number and size of several branching lines was increased. One more siding line were added on the east side, while the existing platform line was extended. The number of track change points was increased, while the A cabin was shifted further South, among other changes.

Station layout
All station design by Rupesh Kumar of ICT 5 of the 8 platforms at Virar are laid out side by side. Platform 3T & 4T are constructed a few meters north of platform 2 & handle the local trains travelling between Dahanu Road and Virar. Platform no. 1 at Virar is constructed approximately 200 meters South of Platform 2 similar to platform 3 at Borivali.

Platforms 2 & 3 are terminal platforms and handle the local trains moving in the up direction. It can handle only 12-coach rakes Platform 45 & 3T handle outstation trains that have a halt at Virar along with the local trains to and fro Dahanu. It can handle 22-coach rakes.

History
Inauguration
The station was introduced as the PanvelDiva railway line, serving as rail freight transport in 1962 and was used for cargo services. The Indian Railways ministry had commissioned the independent commuter railway services in 1964.[4] In addition, a number of development activities have been conducted, including track expansions, electrification of the coaches and addition of long-route express trains.

Proposed terminus development
In 2007, the Central Railways ministries had proposed to develop a terminus, serving the inbound and outbound long distance express trains.[9] According to the general manager, V. K. Kaul, it was announced that the project will be developed with an expenditure of ?22 crore (US$2.8 million).[6] City and Industrial Development Corporation (CIDCO) stated that the corporation also has a two-thirds of expenditure on the project and the CR has the major expenditure plan. However, in 2015 the project was re-announced with a total expenditure of ?126 crore (US$16 million) from the CR ministries.[10] The CR ministries also stated that the development of the terminus will be completed in 2018.[10] The terminus also consists two separate platforms for the express trains.[11]

The MankhurdBelapurPanvel Railway Corridor Line was first commissioned on 25 January 1995 as a single line connecting to Khandeshwar station from Belapur station. The line was subsequently expanded to Panvel on 29 June 1998. On 14 April 2000, the line got subsequently expanded as double line services from Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus to Panvel.[13]

The Panvel/BelapurUran Corridor Line was originally planned in 1996, but later it was halted due to unknown reasons in 2008.[12] According to the 2009 reports, the expenses of the project was around ?1,412.17 crore (US$180 million), including the expenses of constructing foot-over bridges and installation of railway network for Belapur station from the proposed station Sagarganga (Kille).[14] The planned stations between the route including Seawoods, Sagar Sangam, Targhar, Bamandongari, Kharkopar, Gavhan, Ranjanpada, Nava-Sheva, Dronagiri and Uran with a length of 27 kilometres (17 mi), will be developed in the first phase of the project in 2017.[15] Due to the scarcity of the land required for the tracks development, a 4 kilometres (2.5 mi) of forest land between Gavhan and Ranjanpada stations will be acquired by the corporation for phase 2 of the development.[16]

Implementation of shuttle train services
In 2006, the Central Railways ministries had proposed the shuttle train services between Karjat station and Panvel. The plan was implemented as the cargo service trains uses the single track of the PanvelKarjat route.[5] In October 2015, the shuttle train services were started between Diva station and Panvel on the trial basis. Due to the establishment of shuttle train services, the commuters from the New Panvel can travel directly to Diva.[17][18] A new shuttle train service is going to be commissioned between Panvel and Bhiwandi / Vasai / Virar stations which is a 70 km project. Currently,[when?] there are 13 stations on this route. 11 more stations are to be built after the project commences.

Track elevation
In 2012, CIDCO had proposed a 25 kilometres (16 mi) metro corridor of Navi Mumbai Metro, linking from Belapur to the proposed Navi Mumbai International Airport.[19]

However, in January 2016, the CST-Panvel elevated corridor project was proposed by Mumbai Railway Vikas Corporation (MVRC) to connect the route along Palm Beach Marg to the proposed international airport. The corridor, although was originally proposed to link the parallel route between Reay Road and Panvel.[3] The report was revised in February 2016 of the project and was stated that the corridor will be integrated with the Navi Mumbai Metro, connecting the Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport to the proposed airport.[20][21]
